# `craft.assets`

You can access your site’s [assets](../assets.md) from your templates via `craft.assets`. It returns an [ElementCriteriaModel](elementcriteriamodel.md) object.

```twig
{% for image in craft.assets.kind('image') %}
    <li><img src="{{ image.getUrl('thumb') }}" alt="{{ image.title }}"></li>
{% endfor %}
```
