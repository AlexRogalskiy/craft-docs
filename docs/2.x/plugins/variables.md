# Template Variables

Craft allows plugins to provide their own template variables, accessible from the `{{ craft }}` global variable (e.g. `{{ craft.pluginName }}`).

To give your plugin a template variable, first create a new `variables/` subfolder within your plugin’s folder. Then create a new file in that folder, named with this format:

```
[PluginHandle]Variable.php
```

If your plugin name is “Cocktail Recipes”, the variable file would be named `CocktailRecipesVariable.php`.

Create a new class in that file, with the same name as the filename:

```php
<?php
namespace Craft;

class CocktailRecipesVariable
{
    public function findIngredients($criteria)
    {
        $criteria = new CocktailRecipes_IngredientCriteria($criteria);
        return craft()->cocktailRecipes->findIngredients($criteria);
    }

    public function findIngredient($criteria)
    {
        $criteria = new CocktailRecipes_IngredientCriteria($criteria);
        return craft()->cocktailRecipes->findIngredient($criteria);
    }
}
```

The specific functions that go in your variable are entirely up to you.

Many of your template variable methods will likely be simple wrappers for your [service](services.md) API methods. It’s important to remember not to expose state-changing methods, however.
