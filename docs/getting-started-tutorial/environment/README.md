# Local development

We’ll start by installing Craft CMS directly on your computer in a local _development environment_.

Craft CMS is a web application meant for a web server, and a local development environment provides web server software on your personal workstation. This way, we can work with Craft freely and privately without the need to set up a hosting account.

To get up and running, we’ll need to get familiar with three tools:

1. The command line utility that’s built into your operating system.
2. A local web server that meets [Craft’s minimum requirements](/3.x/requirements.md).
3. A code editor.
