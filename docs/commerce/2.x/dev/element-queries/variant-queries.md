# Variant Queries

You can fetch variants in your templates or PHP code using **variant queries**.

::: code
```twig
{# Create a new variant query #}
{% set myVariantQuery = craft.variants() %}
```
```php
// Create a new variant query
$myVariantQuery = \craft\commerce\elements\Variant::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created a variant query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/element-queries.html#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Variant](commerce2:craft\commerce\elements\Variant) objects will be returned.

::: tip
See [Element Queries](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/element-queries.html) in the Craft docs to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example

We can display a specific variant by its ID by doing the following:

1. Create a variant query with `craft.variants()`.
2. Set the [id](#id) parameter on it.
3. Fetch the variant with `.one()`.
4. Output information about the variant as HTML.

```twig
{# Get the requested variant ID from the query string #}
{% set variantId = craft.app.request.getQueryParam('id') %}

{# Create a variant query with the 'id' parameter #}
{% set myVariantQuery = craft.variants()
    .id(variantId) %}

{# Fetch the variant #}
{% set variant = myVariantQuery.one() %}

{# Make sure it exists #}
{% if not variant %}
    {% exit 404 %}
{% endif %}

{# Display the variant #}
<h1>{{ variant.title }}</h1>
<!-- ... -->
```

```php
// Fetch all variants, regardless of status
$variants = \craft\commerce\elements\Variant::find()
    ->anyStatus()
    ->all();
```
:::


### `asArray`

Causes the query to return matching variants as arrays of data, rather than [Variant](commerce2:craft\commerce\elements\Variant) objects.





::: code
```twig
{# Fetch variants as arrays #}
{% set variants = craft.variants()
    .asArray()
    .all() %}
```

| `['and', '>= 2018-04-04', '< 2018-05-01']` | that were created between 2018-04-01 and 2018-05-01.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch variants created last month #}
{% set start = date('first day of last month')|atom %}
{% set end = date('first day of this month')|atom %}

{% set variants = craft.variants()
    .dateCreated(['and', ">= #{start}", "< #{end}"])
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch variants created last month
$start = (new \DateTime('first day of last month'))->format(\DateTime::ATOM);
$end = (new \DateTime('first day of this month'))->format(\DateTime::ATOM);

$variants = \craft\commerce\elements\Variant::find()
    ->dateCreated(['and', ">= {$start}", "< {$end}"])
    ->all();
```

    ->dateUpdated(">= {$lastWeek}")
    ->all();
```
:::

{% set variants = craft.variants()
    .id([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .fixedOrder()
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch variants in a specific order
$variants = \craft\commerce\elements\Variant::find()

    .one() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the variant by its ID
$variant = \craft\commerce\elements\Variant::find()
    ->id(1)
    ->one();
```
:::



::: tip
This can be combined with [fixedOrder](#fixedorder) if you want the results to be returned in a specific order.
:::


### `ignorePlaceholders`

Causes the query to return matching variants as they are stored in the database, ignoring matching placeholder
elements that were set by [craft\services\Elements::setPlaceholderElement()](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-services-elements.html#method-setplaceholderelement).










### `inReverse`

Causes the query results to be returned in reverse order.





::: code
```twig
{# Fetch variants in reverse #}
{% set variants = craft.variants()
    .inReverse()
    .all() %}

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch all variants except for the first 3 #}
{% set variants = craft.variants()
    .offset(3)
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch all variants except for the first 3
$variants = \craft\commerce\elements\Variant::find()
    ->offset(3)
    ->all();
```
:::


### `orderBy`

Determines the order that the variants should be returned in.



::: code

$variants = \craft\commerce\elements\Variant::find()
    ->orderBy('dateCreated asc')
    ->all();
```
:::


### `preferSites`

If [unique](#unique) is set, this determines which site should be selected when querying multi-site elements.



For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,
and this is set to `['c', 'b', 'a']`, then Foo will be returned for Site C, and Bar will be returned
for Site B.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique variants from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A #}
{% set variants = craft.variants()
    .site('*')
    .unique()
    .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique variants from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A
