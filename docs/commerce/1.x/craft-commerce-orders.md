# craft.commerce.orders

## How to get orders

You can access your site’s orders from your templates via `craft.commerce.orders`
It returns an [ElementCriteriaModel](https://craftcms.com/docs/2.x/templating/elementcriteriamodel.html) object.

```twig
{% set orders = craft.commerce.orders.find() %}

{% for order in orders %}
    {{ order.number }} - {{ order.totalPrice}} <br>
{% endfor %}
```

## Parameters

`craft.commerce.orders` supports the following parameters:

### type

Product Type model or handle.

### typeId

Product type ID.

### number

The unique hash of the order.

### completed

Accepts `true`.  e.g `{% set orders = craft.commerce.orders.completed(true).find() %}` would return completed orders since they have `isCompleted` set to true.

### isCompleted

Accepts `1` or `not 1`.  e.g `{% set orders = craft.commerce.orders.isCompleted('not 1').find() %}` would return incomplete orders (carts) since they have `isCompleted` set to false.

### dateOrdered

The date the order was completed.

### orderStatus

accepts an `orderStatus` model.

### orderStatusId

### customer

A customer Model can be passed to get orders for that customer only. e.g `{% set orders = craft.commerce.orders.customer(craft.commerce.customer).find() %}`
Do not use this to get a cart, as the default response does not include orders that are still
carts (use `{% set cart = craft.commerce.getCart %}` to get the current user’s cart).

### user

A customer Model can be passed to get orders for that user only. e.g `{% set orders = craft.commerce.orders.user(currentUser).find() %}`
Do not use this to get a cart, as the default response does not include orders that are still
carts (use `{% set cart = craft.commerce.getCart %}` to get the current user’s cart).
