# Setting Things Up

There are a few simple steps that you must go through each time you create a new plugin.

## Pick a Name and Handle

The first step in creating a plugin is to pick a user-facing name. Craft doesn’t really have any restrictions on what that can be, besides that it must be textual.

Once you have a name, you need to decide on your plugin’s **handle**. This will be used as a prefix for all of your plugin’s class names. It should be based on your plugin’s user-facing name, except without any spaces, hyphens, underscores, or punctuation, and it must use StudlyCase.

Here are some examples of plugin names and handles:

| User-Facing Name  | Handle
| ----------------- | -----------------
| Cocktail Recipes  | `CocktailRecipes`
| P&T Field Pack    | `PtFieldPack`
| ACME Tennis Balls | `AcmeTennisBalls`


## Create Your Plugin’s Folder

All of a plugin’s files are contained within a single folder, including its front-end resources. That folder lives in `craft/plugins/`.

Name your folder after your plugin’s handle, except it should be **completely lowercase**.

## Your Primary Plugin Class

There’s only one mandatory file that each plugin needs, and that file defines your plugin’s **primary class**. This class tells Craft some basic information about your plugin: its name, version number, its developer’s name and URL, etc.

Create the file at the root of your plugin directory. It should be named with your plugin’s handle, plus `Plugin.php`, e.g. `CocktailRecipesPlugin.php`.

Here’s a sample primary plugin file:

```php
<?php
namespace Craft;

class CocktailRecipesPlugin extends BasePlugin
{
    function getName()
    {
         return Craft::t('Cocktail Recipes');
    }

    function getVersion()
    {
        return '1.0';
    }

    function getDeveloper()
    {
        return 'Pixel & Tonic';
    }

    function getDeveloperUrl()
    {
        return 'http://pixelandtonic.com';
    }
}
```

## Plugin Icons

If you want your plugin to have a custom icon in the Control Panel, create a `resources` folder for your plugin and place an `icon.svg` file in it.

Plugins with Control Panel sections can have a custom icon in the global sidebar by placing an `icon-mask.svg` file within their `resources` folder.

### Methods

Your primary plugin class can define the following methods:

#### `defineSettings()`:

Defines the attributes that model your plugin’s available settings. (See [plugin-settings](plugin-settings.md) for more information.)

#### `getDescription()`:

Returns a description of the plugin.

#### `getDeveloper()`:

Returns the developer’s name.

#### `getDeveloperUrl()`:

Returns the developer’s website URL.

#### `getDocumentationUrl()`:

Returns a website URL to the plugin’s online documentation.

#### `getName()`:

Returns the user-facing name.

If your plugin’s name should be translatable, wrap it in `Craft::t()` (see [Internationalization](internationalization.md)). For example, “Cocktail Recipes” would be a good candidate for translation support, but a proper noun like “Akismet” might not.

#### `getReleaseFeedUrl()`:

Returns the plugin’s releases JSON feed URL.

 If the plugin wants to have its updates included in the Updates page, it should provide a JSON feed in the following format:

```javascript
[
    {
        "version": "0.9.0",
        "downloadUrl": "https://download.craftcommerce.com/0.9/Commerce0.9.0.zip",
        "date": "2015-12-01T10:00:00-08:00",
        "notes": [
            "# Big Stuff",
            "[Added] It’s now possible to create new products right from Product Selector Modals (like the ones used by Products fields).",
            "[Improved] Variants are now defined in a new Variant Matrix field, right on the main Edit Product pages.",
            "# Bug Fixes",
            "[Fixed] Fixed a Twig error that occurred if you manually went to /commerce/orders/new. You now receive a 404 error instead."
        ]
    },
    {
        "version": "0.9.1",
        "downloadUrl": "https://download.craftcommerce.com/0.9/Commerce0.9.1.zip",
        "date": "2015-12-01T11:00:00-08:00",
        "notes": [
            "[Fixed] Fixed a PHP error that occurred when creating a new produt when the current user’s username was ‘null’."
        ]
    }
]
```

 Notes:

- The feed must be valid JSON.
- The feed’s URL must begin with “https://” (so it is fetched over SSL).
- Each release must contain `version`, `downloadUrl`, `date`, and `notes` attributes.
- Each release’s `downloadUrl` must begin with “https://” (so it is downloaded over SSL).
- Each release’s `date` must be an ISO-8601-formatted date, as defined by either [DateTime::ATOM](http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php#datetime.constants.atom) or [DateTime::ISO8601](http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php#datetime.constants.iso8601)  (with or without the colon between the hours and minutes of the timezone offset).
- `notes` can either be a string (with each release note separated by a newline character), or an array.
- Release note lines that begin with `#` will be treated as headings.
- Release note lines that begin with `[Added]`, `[Improved]`, or `[Fixed]` will be given `added`, `improved`, and `fixed` classes within the Updates page.
- Release note lines can contain Markdown code, but not HTML.
- Releases can contain a `critical` attribute which can be set to `true` if the release is critical.

#### `getSettingsHtml()`:

Returns the HTML that displays your plugin’s settings. (See [plugin-settings](plugin-settings.md) for more information.)

#### `getSettingsUrl()`:

Returns a URL to your plugin’s settings. This can be used if your plugin requires more control over its settings than you get with `getSettingsHtml()`. If it returns anything, your plugin’s name within Settings → Plugins will link to the returned URL.

```php
public function getSettingsUrl()
{
    return 'myplugin/settings';
}
```

#### `getSourceLanguage()`:

Returns the source language that your plugin was written in. (Defaults to `'en_us'`.)

```php
public function getSourceLanguage()
{
    return 'de';
}
```

#### `getVersion()`:

Returns the plugin’s version number.

#### `getSchemaVersion()`:

If the plugin has database tables, returns the database schema version number for the plugin.  Incrementing this version number will trigger any new migrations your plugin has to run.

#### `hasCpSection()`:

Returns whether the plugin should get its own tab in the CP header. (See [templates](templates.md) for information on that.)

#### `onAfterInstall()`:

Called right after your plugin’s row has been stored in the `plugins` database table, and tables have been created for it based on its [records](records.md).

#### `onBeforeInstall()`:

Called right before your plugin’s row gets stored in the `plugins` database table, and tables have been created for it based on its [records](records.md).

#### `onBeforeUninstall()`:

Called right after your plugin’s record-based tables have been deleted, and its row in the `plugins` table has been deleted.
