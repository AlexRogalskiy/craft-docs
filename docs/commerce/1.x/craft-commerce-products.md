# craft.commerce.products

## How to get products

You can access your site’s products from your templates via `craft.commerce.products`
It returns an [ElementCriteriaModel](https://craftcms.com/docs/2.x/templating/elementcriteriamodel.html) object.

```twig
{% set products = craft.commerce.products.type('normal').find() %}

{% for product in products %}
  {% for variant in product.variants %}
    {{ variant.sku }} - {{ variant.salePrice }} <br>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

### status

Only fetch products with the given status.

Possible values are `'live'`, `'pending'`, `'expired'`, `'disabled'`, and `null`.
The default value is `'live'`. `null` will return all entries regardless of status.

An entry is `live` if it is enabled, has a `availableOn` in the past and an `expiresOn` Date in the future.
An entry is `pending` if it is enabled and has `availableOn` and `expiresOn` Dates in the future.
An entry is `expired` if it is enabled and has `availableOn` and `expiresOn` Dates in the past.

### defaultWidth

For example:

```twig
{% set products = craft.commerce.products.type('tshirt').hasVariant({ color: 'red' }) %}
```

## Variant Parameters

### hasStock

  hasVariant: {
    hasStock: true
  },
}) %}
```
