# Extensibility

Commerce is a flexible and extensible platform. Just like Craft CMS, Commerce provides events so developers can add features to the system.

- [Events](events.md) provide hooks for extending functionality.
- [Purchasables](purchasables.md) add elements to the system that Commerce can sell.
- [Adjusters](adjusters.md) make any price adjustments to an order.
- [Shipping Methods](shipping-methods.md) add third party shipping methods and return shipping prices.
