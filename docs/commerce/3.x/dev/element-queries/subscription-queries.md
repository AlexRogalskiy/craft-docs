# Subscription Queries

You can fetch subscriptions in your templates or PHP code using **subscription queries**.

::: code
```twig
{# Create a new subscription query #}
{% set mySubscriptionQuery = craft.subscriptions() %}
```
```php
// Create a new subscription query
$mySubscriptionQuery = \craft\commerce\elements\Subscription::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created a subscription query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/element-queries.html#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Subscription](commerce3:craft\commerce\elements\Subscription) objects will be returned.

::: tip
See [Element Queries](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/element-queries.html) in the Craft docs to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example

We can display all of the current user’s subscriptions by doing the following:

1. Create a subscription query with `craft.subscriptions()`.
2. Set the [user](#user) parameter on it.
3. Fetch the subscriptions with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the subscriptions using a [for](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/for.html) tag to output their HTML.

```twig
{# Make sure someone is logged in #}
{% requireLogin %}

{# Create a subscription query with the 'user' parameter #}
{% set mySubscriptionQuery = craft.subscriptions()
    .user(currentUser) %}

{# Fetch the subscriptions #}
{% set subscriptions = mySubscriptionQuery.all() %}

{# Display the subscriptions #}
{% for subscription in subscriptions %}
    <article>
        <h1><a href="{{ subscription.url }}">{{ subscription.title }}</a></h1>
        {{ subscription.summary }}
        <a href="{{ subscription.url }}">Learn more</a>
    </article>
{% endfor %}
```

{% set subscriptions = craft.subscriptions()
    .user(currentUser)
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the current user's subscriptions
$user = Craft::$app->user->getIdentity();
$subscriptions = \craft\commerce\elements\Subscription::find()
    ->user($user)

### `userId`

Narrows the query results based on the subscriptions’ user accounts’ IDs.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches subscriptions…
| - | -
| `1` | for a user account with an ID of 1.
| `[1, 2]` | for user accounts with an ID of 1 or 2.
| `['not', 1, 2]` | for user accounts not with an ID of 1 or 2.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch the current user's subscriptions #}
{% set subscriptions = craft.subscriptions()
    .userId(currentUser.id)
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the current user's subscriptions
$user = Craft::$app->user->getIdentity();
$subscriptions = \craft\commerce\elements\Subscription::find()
    ->userId($user->id)
    ->all();
```
:::


### `with`

Causes the query to return matching subscriptions eager-loaded with related elements.



See [Eager-Loading Elements](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/eager-loading-elements.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch subscriptions eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations #}
{% set subscriptions = craft.subscriptions()
    .with(['related'])
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch subscriptions eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations
$subscriptions = \craft\commerce\elements\Subscription::find()
    ->with(['related'])
    ->all();
```
