# Example Templates

Commerce provides example templates for you to use as a reference when building out your commerce solution.

We have 2 sets of example temples, within the folders `shop` and `buy`.

The example templates can by found in the `vendor/craftcms/commerce/templates/` folder, and can be copied to your projects top level `templates/` folder.

If you system supports it, you could also symlink these templates folders into your `templates/` folder so that you always have up-to-date
examples *while in development*.

## Shop

The `shop` folder contains a robust set of templates that do pretty much everything with Commerce, including a full checkout flow, address handling,
order management, subscription management, and cart management.

Copy the `shop` folder to your templates and navigate your browser to `yoursite.test/shop` to see them in action.

## Buy

The `buy` folder contains a simple set of templates that work well for Commerce Lite, where you would only have a “buy now” button and
a simple checkout.

Copy the `buy` folder to your templates and navigate your browser to `yoursite.test/buy` to see it in action.
