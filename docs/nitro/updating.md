# Updating Instructions

If you’ve already installed Nitro and would like to update to the latest version, you’ll need to run [`nitro self-update`](commands.md#self-update) and [`nitro refresh`](commands.md#refresh):

```
nitro self-update
nitro refresh
```

::: warning
If you’re running Windows, you’ll need to perform a [manual installation](installation.md).
