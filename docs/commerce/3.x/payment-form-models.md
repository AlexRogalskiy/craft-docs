# Payment Form Models

The payment form model is a special model used to validate payment parameters and pass them on to a payment gateway in a way it expects.

When returning after a validation error, a `paymentForm` variable will be available to the template and set to an instance of [BasePaymentForm](commerce3:craft\commerce\models\payments\BasePaymentForm).

Each gateway can use its own payment form, however it must extend [BasePaymentForm](commerce3:craft\commerce\models\payments\BasePaymentForm). There are generic models available for use, specifically for gateways passing around credit card information, but you should refer to the documentation of the plugin providing the gateway to see whether it uses its own model.

Generally, you shouldn’t be concerned with the specific type of payment form model being used, as it’s provided by the gateway and doesn’t need to be configured.

## Model Attributes

The following payment form model attributes exist for gateways handling credit card information:

| Attribute      | Validation                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
