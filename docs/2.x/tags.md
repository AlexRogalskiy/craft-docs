# Tags

You can create folksonomies for your [entries](sections-and-entries.md), [users](users.md), and [assets](assets.md) using Tags.

## Tag Groups

Before you can create tags, you must create “tag groups” to contain them. Each tag group holds a unique set of tags, and lets you define a custom set of [fields](fields.md) that should be available to tags within the group.

To create a new tag group, go to Settings → Tags and click the “New Tag Group” button.

## Assigning Tags

To assign tags to things, you must also create a [Tags field](tags-fields.md). Each Tags field is connected to a single tag group. Whatever you attach the field to (entries, assets, users, etc.) will be able to create new tags and create [relations](relations.md) to any of the tags within that group.
