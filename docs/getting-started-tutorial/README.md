# Welcome to Craft CMS!

This tutorial will guide you through installing Craft CMS and creating a demo blog. While it assumes you’re technically-inclined, you don’t need web development experience to follow along. You can also skip any parts you’re already familiar with.

::: tip
If at any point you get stuck, consider [joining us on Discord](https://craftcms.com/discord) where friendly people can help out.

## Why Craft CMS?

Craft CMS is a content management system for building bespoke websites.

There are lots of options when it comes to choosing a CMS, and Craft CMS is a blank slate that puts your content first. It provides a flexible, tailored experience for developers and content authors.

We’ll build an example blog since that’s a common use for a CMS, but the tutorial will introduce you to building blocks you can use for building _any_ kind of content. (This is where Craft CMS shines!)

## What We’re Going to Do

We’re going to get Craft CMS running in a local environment, create a blog from scratch, and look at a few ways you might launch the site publicly. All you’ll need is yourself, your computer, and a healthy sense of adventure.
