# Editions

Craft Commerce comes in two editions, Lite and Pro. Both editions can be trialled for free in a local development environment, for as long as you need.

## Pro

The Pro edition of Craft Commerce is designed for professional ecommerce sites. This would usually include a cart customers can update and a multi-page checkout flow.

## Lite

The Lite edition of Craft Commerce is designed for websites that need only the basics, where one-off product sales, complex tax and shipping rules, promotion management, and shopping carts would be overkill.

In the Lite edition of Craft Commerce only a single line item can exist in the cart. Whenever a customer adds something to the cart, it replaces whatever item was in the cart. If multiple items are added to the cart in a single request, only the last item that was submitted is added to the cart.

Although a cart always exists technically, a customer’s experience with Lite would probably not expose a cart UI on the front-end. For example, the customer probably shouldn't see a cart icon in the corner of the page like you would see in a traditional ecommerce design. A single ‘buy now’ button should be the call-to-action and the customer would go straight to providing email, shipping and payment information on a single screen.
